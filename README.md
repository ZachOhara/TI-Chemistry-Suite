#TI Chemistry Suite

A suite of TI-84 programs that will make your life easier in a chemistry class. These programs are intended for optimal use on a TI-84 C Silver Edition. They should also work, but with less clarity and usability, on the normal TI-84 Silver Edition and possibly on the TI-83. The programs here are provided as-is, with no garuntee of support.

###CHEMCNST
A library of constants that are commonly used in chemisty. As of now, it includes Avogadro's number, the mass of an electron (in kilograms), Plank's constant (in joule-seconds), The speed of light (in meters per second), the ideal gas law constant (in (L\*atm)/(mol\*k)) and the molar volume at standard temperature and pressure (in liters per mole).

###IDEALGAS
Solutions to the ideal gas law (PV=nRT) to calculate pressure (K), temperature (atm), volume (L), or amount (mol), provided that the other three are known
