#TI Chemistry Suite

A suite of TI-84 programs that will make your life easier in a chemistry class. These programs are intended for optimal use on a TI-84 C Silver Edition. They should also work, but with less clarity and usability, on the normal TI-84 Silver Edition and possibly on the TI-83. The programs here are provided as-is, with no garuntee of support. Below is a breif description of what each program does.

##Contents

###CHEMCNST
Short for "chemistry constants," this is a library of constants that are commonly used in chemisty. As of now, it includes Avogadro's number, the mass of an electron (in kilograms), Plank's constant (in joule-seconds), The speed of light (in meters per second), the ideal gas law constant (in (L\*atm)/(mol\*k)) and the molar volume at standard temperature and pressure (in liters per mole).

###IDEALGAS
Solutions to the ideal gas law (PV=nRT) to calculate pressure (atm), temperature (K), volume (L), or amount (mol), provided that the other three are known. Results for temperature will be given in both Kelvin and Celsius, but the program only accepts Kelvin. Have your units ready before you use!


###ISSOLUBL
The name is a shortened "is soluble." Like the name says, this program will determine if an ionic compound is soluble or insoluble in water according to the eight solubility rules. When inputting the ions, do not include any charges in the input, and only include an amount if it is relevant to the ion (such as Hg2 versus Hg, which both have a 2+ charge). Within the code, there are comments describing the eight rules of solubility, so this program is also useful for reference.
